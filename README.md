This project guides you through creating a website that predicts real estate prices step by step. First, we'll use sklearn and linear regression on a dataset from kaggle.com to build a model. Next, we'll write a Python flask server to handle predictions. Lastly, we'll create a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where users can input home Area, BHK(Bedroom, Hall, and Kitchen), Bath, Location to get a predicted price. Throughout, we'll cover various data science topics like cleaning data, handling outliers, creating features, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc.
In terms of technology and tools, this project includes:

1. Python: The primary programming language for the project.
2. Numpy and Pandas: Used for cleaning and manipulating data.
3. Matplotlib: Employed for visualizing the data.
4. Sklearn: Utilized for building the predictive model.
5. Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm: Chosen as Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) for coding.
6. Python Flask: Employed to create the HTTP server for handling requests.
7. HTML/CSS/Javascript: Used to craft the user interface for the website.
